# AlexaControlledLEDs
Program to control LEDs using Amazon Alexa voice controls

I worked on this project at the end of my Sophomore year of high school in 2019. I had receivied a set of LED lights with an infared remote and decided to create a way to activate the lights using my voice instead of the remote. I used an Arduino Nano, ESP8266 WiFi chip, and a breadboard to connect them all to an infared sensor/light. I created this Arduino code to allow a connection to an Amazon Alexa. The program inputs commands from the Alexa and then shoots the corresponding IR codes from the IR light to the IR receiver on the LED lights. I made commands to turn the lights on/off, change the brightness, change the colors, and turn on some of the specialty modes that flash different patterns of colors.
